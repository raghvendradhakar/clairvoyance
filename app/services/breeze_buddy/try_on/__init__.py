"""Virtual try-on for the Buddy Assist widget.

Clairvoyance owns the gates, the money and the generation itself.

The photo passes through in memory and is never persisted here — not to
``chat_message``, ``ui_blocks``, ``agent_session_state``, or a log line.
The only try-on state kept is a counter in the session state and, for ten
minutes, one generated image keyed by ``request_id`` (see ``cache``).
