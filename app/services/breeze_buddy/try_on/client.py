"""Virtual try-on generation on Vertex AI.

A reply with no image at all is retried once: the same request usually
succeeds the second time, and the caller bills on success only, so the
shopper is never charged for the empty one. A refusal is never retried —
it is about this photo, and would be refused again.

The credentials are the ones the Vertex LLM providers already use, so
try-on adds no configuration of its own.
