"""Credit deduction for billable events (chat turns, voice calls, ...).

Strategy pattern: BILLING_RULES maps an event_type to a callable that
computes how many credits that event costs. deduct() looks up the rule by
event_type and dispatches -- adding a new billable event type (e.g. a
different chat surface, or a new voice product) is a one-line addition to
this dict, never a change to deduct() itself or its callers.
